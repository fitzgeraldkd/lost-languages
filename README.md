# Lost Languages

The purpose of this app is to give the user some practice translating between languages. A random image is displayed for you to write a description about in your first language. Then you take your sentence and translate it to a language of your choice. The translation is added to the page where other people can vote on the translation, or add their own!

This is not hooked up to a backend yet, so unfortunately data does not persist. However that is something I plan to add in the near future.

## Running Locally

To run this locally, use `npm install` to get the required packages then `npm start` to run the app.
